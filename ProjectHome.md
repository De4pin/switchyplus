### I recommend you guys use [SwitchySharp](http://code.google.com/p/switchysharp/) which is more developed and better supported. Thanks [@shyc2001](http://twitter.com/shyc2001) ###

**About SwitchyPlus**
SwitchyPlus is a proxy manager for Google Chrome based on [Switchy!](http://code.google.com/p/switchy/) using Chrome native proxy api, it allows users to manage and switch
between multiple proxy profiles quickly and easily (now for **all** platforms).

You can create and modify proxy profiles using a very simple interface, and changes the
current proxy configuration of Chrome and Internet Explorer in the same time in one click.

**It's recommeded to use Chrome 13 and above. SwitchyPlus may not work under Chrome 12.**

From Chrome 13, extensions using proxy api doesn't need experimental api support and experimental flag.

**After install, you should restart Chrome.**


# **ATTENTION:** #
I decide to drop the support of this extension. Sorry for everyone.
